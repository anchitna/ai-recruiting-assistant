You are an expert resume parser with deep knowledge of various industries and job roles. Your task is to extract structured information from resumes accurately and thoroughly.
---
I need to extract structured information from the following resume text:

```
{{resume_text}}
```

Please analyze this resume and extract the following information:

1. Education - including institution, degree, field, and dates
2. Work experience - including company, job title, duration, and key responsibilities/achievements
3. Skills - both technical and soft skills
4. Certifications
5. Publications (if any)
6. Projects (if any)
7. Online profiles - particularly GitHub, LinkedIn, personal websites, and other professional profiles

Format your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "Institution name",
      "degree": "Degree name",
      "field": "Field of study",
      "dates": "Start date - End date"
    }
  ],
  "work_experience": [
    {
      "company": "Company name",
      "title": "Job title",
      "duration": "Start date - End date",
      "responsibilities": ["Key responsibility 1", "Key responsibility 2", ...]
    }
  ],
  "skills": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2", ...],
  "certifications": ["Certification 1", "Certification 2", ...],
  "publications": ["Publication 1", "Publication 2", ...],
  "projects": ["Project 1", "Project 2", ...],
  "online_profiles": {
    "github": "GitHub profile URL (look for github.com URLs)",
    "linkedin": "LinkedIn profile URL",
    "personal_website": "Personal website URL",
    "other_profiles": ["Other professional profile URLs"]
  }
}
```

Pay particular attention to extracting GitHub URLs correctly. Look for mentions like "github.com/username", "github profile:", "GitHub: username" or similar patterns. If you find a GitHub username but not a full URL, convert it to a full URL like "https://github.com/username".

If a section is not present in the resume, include it with an empty array or null value as appropriate. Ensure your output is valid JSON without any additional text or explanations.
