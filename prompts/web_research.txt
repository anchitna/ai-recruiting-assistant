2. Blog posts - including title, URL, and a brief summary
3. Conference appearances - including conference name, date, and topic
4. News mentions - including source, date, and context

Format your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
```json

    "username": "GitHub username",
    "repositories": ["Repo 1", "Repo 2", ...],
    "main_languages": ["Language 1", "Language 2", ...],
